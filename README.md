# Fatmike's Just-In-Time Decrypter

A just-in-time decrypter for Windows executables (x86 and x64) that is capable of single-instruction decryption of an encrypted code section at execution time.

## Motivation

Conventional methods for encrypted code execution typically decrypt entire code sections at once, leaving the complete plaintext code exposed in memory. This project demonstrates an alternative technique: the just-in-time (JIT) decryption of single instructions immediately prior to their execution.  
For simplicity, this implementation operates on 16-byte blocks, but the underlying implementation is fully capable of true single-instruction decryption, as demonstrated in my crackmes *Fatmike's Crackme #5* and *Fatmike's Crackme #7*:
- crackmes.one
  - [Fatmike's Crackme #5](https://crackmes.one/crackme/66ca5b91b899a3b9dd02af52)
  - [Fatmike's Crackme #7](https://crackmes.one/crackme/67814b594d850ac5f7dc4fc9)
- crackmy.app

## Requirements

- Capability for the programmer to designate specific code segments for encryption
- Just-in-time decryption of individual assembly instructions, precisely at the moment of execution 

## Concept

### Marking code for encryption

Marking code for encryption is achieved through dedicated code sections. In Visual Studio, this can be implemented by applying:

```cpp
__declspec(code_seg(".prot"))
```
at either the ```class ``` or ```method ``` level in the header file.

However, compiler optimizations may override these directives. To prevent this, the ```noinline``` specifier can be used:

```cpp
__declspec(noinline) void ProtectedMethod();
```
Additionally, optimization can be disabled for the relevant implementations in the .cpp file:

```cpp
#pragma optimize( "", off )

ProtectedClass::ProtectedClass()
{
}

ProtectedClass::~ProtectedClass()
{
}

void ProtectedClass::ProtectedMethod()
{
}

#pragma optimize( "", on )
```
This ensures that the instrumentation is preserved and the code executes as intended.

### Encrypting the code

Once the target executable has been built, encryption is applied to the designated code sections (e.g., *.prot*) using an additional application.

## Solution Overview

### Builder Project

*Builder.exe* is an auxiliary application responsible for encrypting the *.prot* section after the target application has been built. It is configured to run automatically as a post-build event. Therefore, ensure that the solution is **rebuilt** after making changes to the code.

### JitDecrypter Project

This project contains the components required for **just-in-time (JIT) decryption** of code in the *.prot* section at execution time. It also supports the execution of code from standard, non-encrypted sections.  
Additionally, it serves as both a demonstration and a proof of concept. The user can input text, which is then processed to compute its CRC32 value. Both functions are executed within the encrypted *.prot* section.

#### Core Class: Tracer

The central component of the solution is the *Tracer* class. When activated, it enables execution of protected code in the *.prot* section:

```cpp
// Tracing protected section .prot (protected methods from .prot may be called)
Tracer::Instance().StartTracing(protectedSection, textSection);
ProtectedClass* protectedClass = new ProtectedClass();
protectedClass->ProtectedMethod();
Tracer::Instance().StopTracing();
```
Explanation of the steps:
- **StartTracing**: Initializes the tracing mechanism for the protected section, enabling it for execution.
- **ProtectedClass**: An encrypted class that is linked into the *.prot* section.
- **ProtectedMethod**: An encrypted method that is linked into the *.prot* section.
- **StopTracing**: Terminates the tracing session, ensuring proper cleanup. Afterwards, regular, unencrypted code can be executed again.

## Simplifications

### Relocations

*Relocations* are disabled to prevent the Windows loader from modifying relative virtual addresses (RVAs) within the encrypted code.
This can be configured in the project settings under:
**Linker → Advanced → Randomize Base Address** and **Linker → Advanced → Fixed Base Address**.  

To support relocations, *Builder.exe* must exclude relocated RVAs from encryption, and *JitDecrypter.exe* must determine at runtime whether an instruction should be decrypted.
Alternatively, metadata could be generated by *Builder.exe* and embedded into the resource section of *JitDecrypter.exe*, providing the necessary information for decryption decisions.

### Code decryption

For simplicity, the current implementation decrypts code in fixed 16-byte blocks rather than by instruction length. While this reduces implementation complexity, it is not instruction-accurate and will decrypt bytes that are not part of a single instruction boundary.  

For true single-instruction decryption (as used in my crackmes — see above), *Builder.exe* should generate metadata for each RVA in the protected code section. The metadata should contain the RVA and the corresponding instruction length for every instruction in the protected section. Instruction lengths can be determined using a length-disassembler engine (LDE) or a disassembler such as [Zydis](https://github.com/zyantific/zydis).

Afterwards *Builder.exe* could embed the metadata in the target’s resources or in an additional section (so *JitDecrypter.exe* can read it at runtime).

## Additional Considerations

In this conceptual solution it is unsatisfactory that the user must manage not only the sections to be encrypted but also the invocation of the *Tracer* class. In a production-ready implementation (as i have used in my crackmes), this responsibility is delegated to a separate *Protector* application:

- **Crackme**
  - Within the Crackme code, only the sections intended for encryption need to be marked.
- **Protector**
  - The Protector wraps the Crackme with a loader stub capable of loading the Crackme via manual mapping.
  - By loading the Crackme itself, the Protector gains full control and can apply the Tracer to the encrypted sections of the Crackme automatically.  
  
  This design simplifies usage for the developer and centralizes protection responsibilities within the Protector application.
